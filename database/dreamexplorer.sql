With a view of easing the general’s life in terms of commuting as well as with the attempt to broad the spectrum to long distance travels, I planned this DreamExplorer.<br/>\r\nAs the name itself suggests, DreamExplorer targets the creative local lives of Nepal, who wish to explore their dreams of travelling. The one hindrance that all are facing nowadays is the bulk finance necessary for owning a vehicle. Through this DreamExplorer we connect people with their dreams without letting them suffer for the huge costs incurred in buying and maintaining a vehicle with a special option of either including or excluding the driver. Just rent it as per your time schedule for many days you want and you’re in the go.<br/>\r\n\"Why Own, when you can just Rent and have all the perks of owning\"<br/>\r\n!!!JUST EXPLORE!!!</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-1\"></div>');
